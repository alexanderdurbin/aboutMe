  <h1>My Path to Software Development</h1>

  <h3>Welcome to the interwebs! Hello world! and all that.</h3>
  <div class = "intro">
    <p>I'm learning to code my way into the world and I invite you to come with me. This site will initially serve as my online journal where I will log my progress and what I have learned. I'll share what has worked well and what has worked not so well.

    <h3>
      What we've done so far
    </h3>
    
    <p>
       I'd learned a lot of C++, Java and Visual Basic in highschool, so I'm starting with a minor advantage in that regard. However, that was 12 years ago, so it's basically like starting over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing I did when trying to teach myself software and webdevelopment for the modern age was to reach out to my friends and family who are already involved. I asked them what skills are most useful to their daily routine and what resources they themselves are using. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The most useful resources I collected from that are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start coding</li>
      <li>Use online resources (you're here!)
          <ul>
            <li> Codility</li>
            <li> MIT OpenCourseware</li>
            <li> CodeAcademy</li>
            <li> Get a profile on StackOverflow / GitHub</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Find some books to read
        <ul>
          <li> Add something here later</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
       Start Coding
    </h3>

    <p>
       This can prove to be one of the most frustrating things. When I first made the decision to try and make the career shift into software development, I was not entirely sure where to begin. There are literally thousands of different ways and venues to choose from.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're stuck on what to work on, Codility and CodeAcademy can be a great way to get some experience coding and working on different puzzles to see where your aptitude is at and where your interests lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also found StackOverflow to be a great place to hunt down projects that people are currently working on and to find out whether or not those are the types of things that I would like to build myself. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, there are lots of people working with databases out there. Looking at all the issues and kinds of projects that tend to come along with that made me want to gouge my eyes out, so I determined that maybe SQL is not very high on my list, although I probably wouldn't refuse if it were necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
       And that's the big thing about getting started. Never say 'no'.  Cast a wide net if you're going to make a major shift like stepping into software development.  You can pigeon-hole yourself rather quickly and find that there are not a whole lot of opportunities out there unless you are <strong> really <i>really</i></strong> good at that one thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, you have to start somewhere. So you might as well become really well versed in one thing at a time.  The point being this: don't marry yourself to one idea out of the gate.  Keep an open mind about where you want to end up. </p>
    <p>
      And above all, be willing to learn.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Use Online Resources
    </h3>
      <p>
        There are a great many resources available online to learn how to code. You're already staring at one!  The best ones are the easiest ones to find. And there is a lot to be said for having the patience to just sit and read the manuals available on the Microsoft website.
